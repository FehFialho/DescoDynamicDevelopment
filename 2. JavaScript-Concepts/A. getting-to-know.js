// Lesson 2A - Getting to know JavaScript and its features (09/16/2025)

// ==============================
//  General Concepts of JavaScript
// ==============================

// JavaScript is an object-oriented, multi-platform scripting language.

// Within a host environment (a web browser), JavaScript can be connected 
// to the objects of that environment to provide programmatic control over them.

// JavaScript has a standard library of objects, such as: Array, Date, and Math,
// and a set of elements that form the core of the language, such as: 
// operators, control structures, and declarations.

// ==============================
//  Programming with JavaScript
// ==============================

// The core of JavaScript can be divided into two main environments:

// ► Client-side:
//    Provides objects to control the web browser and interact with the 
//    DOM (Document Object Model) and user events.

// ► Server-side:
//    Provides objects for running JavaScript on a server,
//    allowing operations like database access and file handling.

// ==============================
//  JavaScript is not Java
// ==============================

// JavaScript follows basic Java syntax, naming conventions, and control flow structures, but it is not Java.
// It uses a runtime system based on a small number of data types, representing numeric values, booleans, and strings.

// Functions do not require special declarative syntax, and can be object properties and executed as methods.

// You do not need to declare all variables, classes, and methods.
// There is no need to worry about methods being public, private, or protected.

// Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

// ==============================
//  JavaScript vs. Java
// ==============================

// ► Object Orientation:
// JavaScript: 
//  Object-oriented. No distinction between types and objects.
//  Inheritance is done through prototypes. 
//  Properties and methods can be dynamically added to any object.
// Java:
//  Class-based. Objects are divided into classes and instances.
//  Inheritance is done through class hierarchies.
//  Classes and instances cannot have properties or methods added dynamically.

// ► Variable Typing:
// JavaScript: Variable data types do not need to be declared (dynamic typing).
// Java: Variable data types must be declared (static typing).

// ► Disk Access:
// JavaScript: Cannot automatically write to the hard disk.
// Java: Can automatically write to the hard disk.

// ► Compilation:
// JavaScript: Interpreted language (not compiled).
// Java: Compiled language.

// ==============================
// ECMAScript Standardization
// ==============================

// ECMAScript is standardized by Ecma International — 
// the European association for the standardization of 
// communication and information systems.

// ECMAScript is documented under specification ECMA-262.

// ECMA-262 is also approved by ISO (International Organization 
// for Standardization) as ISO-16262.
