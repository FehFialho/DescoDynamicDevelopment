  Lesson 1B - Adding Script to a HTML File (09/16/2025)

  ===============================================
  HOW TO IMPORT A JAVASCRIPT FILE INTO HTML
  ===============================================

  To use JavaScript in an HTML page, you can link an external .js file using the <script> tag with the 'src' (source) attribute.

  Syntax: <script src="yourfile.js"></script>

  The <script> tag is usually placed before the closing </body> tag, but it can also be placed in the <head> if necessary.
  If placed in the <head>, the script will run before the page content is loaded, which might cause issues if your script depends on HTML elements.
  To avoid that, you can use the 'defer' or 'async' attributes if needed.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Lesson 1B - Script Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Test</h1>
  <!-- Page content goes here -->

  <!-- Linking external JavaScript file at the end of body for safer loading -->
  <script src="./A_javascript-and-node.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

<!-- 
  In the example above:
  - "A. javascript-and-node.js" is the external JavaScript file located in the same folder as the HTML file.
  - The script will run as the browser parses the <head>.
  - If "A_javascript-and-node.js" includes code that interacts with elements in the body, itâ€™s better to place it at the end of the body like this:

    <body>
      (HTML content here)
      <script src="A. javascript-and-node.js"></script>
    </body>
